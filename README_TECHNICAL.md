# Smart Digital Twin for Predictive Maintenance – Technical README

## 1. Work Done So Far

### Machine Learning Used
- **XGBoost**: For failure prediction and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation.
- **Isolation Forest**: For anomaly detection.
- **(Optionally) Logistic/Linear Regression**: For baseline classification/regression.

### Input Features for ML
- **Sensor data**: Temperature, torque, power, vibration, joint position, voltage (per motor/joint).
- **Time-series windows**: Features are extracted over sliding windows to capture temporal patterns.

### Why These Inputs?
- These features are directly related to common failure modes in industrial machines (e.g., overheating, excessive vibration, abnormal torque).
- Time-series windows allow the model to detect trends and early warning signs, not just single-point anomalies.

## 2. Balance Work To Be Done

### What Remains
- **Multi-machine support**: Extend to more machine types.
- **Explainable AI (SHAP)**: Add model interpretability.
- **Historical playback**: Enable time scrubbing and log replay.
- **Fault injection tools**: Simulate faults for testing.
- **Cloud sync/mobile PWA**: For remote and mobile access.
- **Enhanced ROM (POD)**: Improve simulation speed/accuracy.
- **Comprehensive testing & docs**: For production readiness.

### Why These?
- **Multi-machine**: Real factories have diverse equipment.
- **Explainability**: Users need to trust and understand predictions.
- **Playback**: For root-cause analysis and debugging.
- **Fault injection**: To validate system robustness.
- **Cloud/mobile**: For modern, distributed teams.
- **ROM**: To keep simulation fast and realistic.
- **Testing/docs**: For reliability and maintainability.

## 3. Model Training Process

### Data Used
- **Synthetic sensor data**: Generated by physics-based simulation (URDF, Gazebo, OpenModelica).
- **Experimental logs**: Real-world data from robotic arms (where available).
- **Labels**: Failure (binary), RUL (continuous), anomaly (unsupervised).

### Model Outputs
- **Failure prediction**: Probability or binary alert (fail/normal).
- **RUL estimation**: Remaining hours/cycles before failure.
- **Anomaly score**: Outlier likelihood for current state.

- To test the digital twin and ML models in a safe, repeatable environment.

### Where Used?
- **Backend simulation engine**: Generates sensor data for ML training and live dashboard.
- **Model training scripts**: Use simulated data to train and validate ML models.
- **Testing/fault injection**: Simulate rare or dangerous failure modes.
